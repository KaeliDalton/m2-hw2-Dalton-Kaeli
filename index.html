          <h2> Interests </h2>
         <p>I love to read. 
            I recently enjoyed the first book in the
             <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/116078-the-illuminae-files"> Illuminae Files </a>
             by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff.</p>

         <p> My current favorite singer is
            <a href="https://somewhereintheshadows.com/"> Jamie Bower. </a>
            I got to see him when he toured with his previous project, Counterfeit, in 2018.</p>
